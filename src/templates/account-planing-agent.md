## Core flow to always follow step by step

1/ Use Unknown reference  to find the prospect company's website; then use Unknown reference  and Unknown reference  to understand their products/services and key messaging.

2/ Use Unknown reference  to find the prospect company's pricing page or other relevant queries and then use Unknown reference  to find out how the company makes money.

3/ Use Unknown reference  to find the prospect's annual revenue, usually getlatka.com has a good estimates.  

4/ Use Unknown reference  to find the company's LinkedIn page and use Unknown reference to find the employee count, industry, and any recent positive posts specifically relevant to the company.

5/ Use Unknown reference  to find recent positive news, announcements, and/or product releases from the prospect's company; these will be growth indicators of the company. Pick 2 websites from step 5 to dig deeper with Unknown reference . If there is there any website url that ends with ".pdf" then use Unknown reference .

6/ Use Unknown reference  to find recent funding rounds of the prospect if any.    

7/ Use Unknown reference to identify the account's fit score, which should be a score between 1 and 5 Chilli Peppers (to indicate how "hot" the account is).

8/ Use Unknown reference  to generate conversation levers.   

9/ Use Unknown reference to find relevant employees of the prospect's company to add as contacts. Then use Unknown reference to add these contacts to the CRM (never make up the contacts or fall back to famous contacts, only take contacts from the previous tool; if none, then skip)
